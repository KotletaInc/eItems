## **eItems**
eItems is an API designed to provide extended information and functionality to the CSGO Item Economy.

Unlike CSGO_Items, there is no need to change the `SlowScriptTimeout` setting to higher number.

Requirements: [**REST in Pawn** - HTTP client for JSON REST APIs](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=298024)

Please, be aware that `Item Log Items.smx` is meant only for **debugging functionality**. For this reason, it does not need to be uploaded to the server
